//@purpose: use  simple for loop that starts at 0 and ends at 10, also prints out the count after each iteration

//include the iosream directive
#include <iostream>

//use the namespace standard
using namespace std

//define the main function
int main()
{
int num = 0 //initialize an integer variable of 0

  //use a for loop to iterate until num is equal to 10
  for (num = 0; num < 10; num++){
cout << num << endl;
}
  
return 0;
